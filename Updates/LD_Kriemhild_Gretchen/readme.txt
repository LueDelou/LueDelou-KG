--Readme--

!!!ATTENTION!!!

This ghost requires the MadokaRunes font to run properly!

Thankfully, you can find it right there in the file! it should be sitting above ghost and shell with the readme and other files. When you first boot, it'll ask you to install, but i suggest installing the font before you boot! Thank you.

This ghost(and its balloon, Scribbles) was created for the april 2021 Ghost Jam in the Ukagaka Dream Team discord. 

Please let me know if anything's acting funky!
