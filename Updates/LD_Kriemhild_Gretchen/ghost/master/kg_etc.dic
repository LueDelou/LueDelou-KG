//---------------------------Miscellaneous Functions--------------------------

//This .dic file is concerned with a number of functions that didn't quite fit in anywhere else. If you're adding new functions, this may be the place to do it! This also has the functions related to updating your ghost, among others. Most of this will just be replacing placeholder dialogue with dialogue more appropriate for your ghost, and this file is fairly long. On the positive side, you'll probably only have to go through it once.
//Make sure to read the walkthrough page (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!


//--OnFileDrop2

//OnFileDrop2 handles how your ghost will set an image as the desktop background when someone drags and drops an image on them. You don't need to touch any of the coding here, just replace the dialogue as needed and leave the \q options alone. More about \q options in bootend.dic and in the walkthrough.

//**** Uninstallation ******************************************
//You may have noticed in the configuration menus in menu.dic an option to turn Uninstall on or off, as well as a greyed out option to uninstall in the right click menu. These following functions relate to the uninstallation process when it's on. Replace the dialogue in each function as we go along.

//--OnVanishButtonHold

	"\1\s[10]This dialogue displays when the user double clicks on the balloon when we're saying we're going to uninstall ourselves.\e"

 //---- OnVanished -----------------------------------------
 //OnVanished is a weird little function. Basically, if you uninstall a ghost, it'll automatically go back to the last ghost you were using. They'll then say this line of dialogue about the ghost you just uninstalled. This is very annoying to test as you can imagine! But unlikely to come up super often, I bet. You might as well be thorough and fill this out as well. Make sure to set up both their poses immediately so they both appear when it switches back to them.

//**** Mail Checking *******************************************************************
//The next set of functions have to do with checking your email. This function is a slippery little thing - I've had people test it following my directions and have it work, but I've never actually gotten it to report back the right amount of emails myself. Very frustrating. But perhaps you'll have more luck with it, haha.
//Girl and Triangle can't actually read your email, they can just tell you how many emails you have. I've seen ghosts that can read the HEADERS of email, but I still don't think ghosts can actually display the contents of an email. You should be using your actual email client for that. It's still kind of a neat feature though.


//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//These text boxes are meant for those who have an interest in expanding or using more complicated functions in their ghost. Also for my own reference in the future since I plan on using this template too, haha. If you have no interest in any of this and just want to keep things as simple as possible, feel free to skip these boxes.

//If you want to set up your ghost to check your mail so you can more easily check these messages instead of just writing the dialogue and moving on, it's a little bit tricky, but not super hard.
//Basically, you're going to need to find your POP settings for your email account. Googling your provider + POP should bring it up pretty quick. Once you have the info, you'll go to the right click menu, options, then preferences. A big menu should pop up, and you should see POP in the left side. Click that, and input all the info from the POP page you looked up for your account. Tell your ghost to check your email, and if it works, then congratulations!

 //**** Network Update *****************************************************************
 //The following functions are for the Network Update of your ghost, where it will connect to your website, check for new files, and update itself. This is a handy feature, but tricky to set up. If you have no intention of using Network Update, you can disregard these, but it won't hurt to fill them out anyway just in case. More details about how to set up Network Update are in the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/).
 
 //Replace the dialogue in the next set of functions as appropriate. You can easily test these messages using the Developer panel. Go to Open at the bottom of it and choose one of the four Update Event options to simulate a Ghost's update process. I highly recommend doing this at LEAST once if you're going to use this feature to make sure it flows well.

WARNING: if you have big plans for your ghost and are going to make a lot of new image files for it (like... i do, cough) at some point, you're going to want to make these messages very brief, if you even have them at all. The reason is because the user will see these messages for EVERY individual file that they have to download, and if you have, say, 50 pna files in the queue, they will see this dialogue 50 times. Not only that, but displaying the dialogue takes some time, so it also extends the download process.
 //If you aren't planning on adding a ton of files at any point, or are only intending to update the .dic files which will be at most a handful of files, then you can go ahead and put a short message in here. But if your ghost is going to grow in leaps and bounds as you work on it, try and keep these messages as brief as possible (or again, just make it "" to have there be no message at all) to make the process that much faster for your user.

 //**** Headlines and RSS Feeds *********************************************************
 //This section has to do with the RSS feeds option on your ghost. If you drag and drop a url on them, they'll add it to a list you can access via the right-click menu, and they'll tell you the last set of updates for the site. This works best with RSS feeds I think, but you can experiment with other sites to see how it works.
 //The headlines you see under the tab are in the headline folder under your base SSP install. So it'd be SSP\headlines. You should see the folders for each linked headline in there. I've very rarely ever messed with them or used them. Likewise, your RSS feeds you've added will be under SSP\rss and I don't think that option will appear in the headlines/RSS tab until you add an RSS feed to a ghost. If you want to clear your RSS feeds or headlines, just delete either of those two folders.

//**** Ghost Creation and Updating ******************************************************
//These next few are related to creating updates2.dau and .nar files for your ghosts. You'll want to at least make a .nar to distribute your ghost, and if you're going to be using Network Update, you'll also want to make updates2.dau as well. It's unlikely that anyone other than you will see these messages, but you should be thorough and replace them anyway.
//Primarily, you will see these messages when you're creating your updates file or updating your ghost.nar file. More on this on the walkthrough page. However, you can drag and drop another ghost's folder onto them and they'll also create a nar for that as well, if for some reason you want to do that.

 //---- OnNarCreating ------------------------------------------------------------------
 //Along the same lines, this is when they begin creating a .nar file for your ghost. .nars are the format most ghosts will be in, something similar to a .zip file, and this is the format you'll be distributing your ghost in most likely. Replace the dialogue with whatever you like.
